## How do we plan to collaborate?
Communication will be carried out daily to inform the rest of the group about what tasks are currently being worked on, decide what should be worked on next, and any issues that are hindering progress.

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
By utilizing a Kanban board and Agile practices applying a “pull” method for selecting work items from the backlog. All of the work, completed and in progress, will be traceable and easily viewed via the Kanban board as well as GitLab. Each item on the Kanban board will be linked to an issue on GitLab.

## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
We will be conducting code reviews along with weekly meetings where we discuss and explain what work has been done since the last meeting. 

## What is our usual communication plan?
Text communication will be through a dedicated channel selected by the group.
Our main communication will be using remote communication tools, meeting at a minimum of three (3) times per week.

## How will we solve conflicts?
All pertainable members will participate in a call, each member then expresses their feelings and concerns about the issue. After they are finished the other member who repeats this same process. Afterwards they together discuss a solution to the conflict. The entire process is mediated by a third-party if necessary.
